Runtime Difference:  
For the Random AI, the time taken is nearly always the same for any number of remaining squares because the algorithm only uses a random number to select an empty spot on the board every time.

For the MiniMax algorithm the time taken decreases as the number of remaining squares decrease because more possible outcomes mean more branches for the algorithm to reach the winning state and vice versa.
